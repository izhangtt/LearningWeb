	<h2>Quick hummus recipe</h2>

    <p>This <a href="test2.html" title="this is baidu">recipe</a> makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

    <p>hummus is a <strong>delicious thick <em>paste</em> used heavily</strong> in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
	<ol>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A <em>dash</em> of olive oil</li>

	</ol>
	
    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
			<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
		</ul>

    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <h4>Storage</h4>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

    hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
